## Overview

Just trying to learn [Elm](https://elm-lang.org), and (maybe) one day have a useful
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co) visual client.  Don't hold your breath for this to 
be useful any time soon.  I have a lot to learn.


Inspired by [rdpatil4/ESClient](https://github.com/rdpatil4/ESClient) which I [forked](https://github.com/rubyisbeautiful/ESClient)
to update for newer ES, and then realized I would have to update **a lot**, so I thought it would be good to redo in Elm as a 
learning project.
